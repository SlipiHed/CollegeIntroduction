        <h1>Slipihed</h1>
        <p>Hello! What's up fellow Lyceans, or some random stranger who managed to find this site on the internet. I created this quick simple website sort of as an introduction for me to tell more about myself and how I got here. So Let’s Dive right into it.</p>

        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>My irl friends and family call me “Ron”, but I usually go by the moniker “slipihed” online, whether it be my discord, github, leetcode, or ign. As of writing I’m currently a freshman at college pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Engineering.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>1) Video Games</h3>
            <p>I used to be addicted to these, I mean come on I think almost everyone has at a certain point of their life right? Especially at these times and ages. I used to play League of Legends a lot, like a lot a lot, an unhealthy amount of a lot, although I only peaked at masters around 50-ish lp and uhm let’s just say I am glad that I was able to get out of that. Nowadays I mostly play chill strategy mobile games like the one I'm playing rn: Sword of Convallaria.</p>

            <h3>2) Movies / Entertainment</h3>
            <p>When I’m not playing games however I usually spend my time binging movies, MCU, DC, Other tv-shows (Sheldon, Big-Bang, Breaking Bad, Rick and Morty) etc. and some anime/manga here and there. Or just the typical doom scrolling through youtube shorts. As of recently though I usually watch youtube/streams from twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/caedrel">caedrel</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen">theprimegean</a>.</p>

            <h3>3) Programming & Current Plans</h3>
            <p>I believe my first time being introduced to programming was during my junior high years (I was about 13 years old). We had html and css as our lessons, followed by pascal, and visual basic 6 but I was never really into it. It was only when I watched some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Danidev">dani’s Videos</a> that I began to dive deep into it (and eventually failed) I remember taking one of those free courses online about c# and unity but after like one week or so I completely forgot about it..</p>
            <p>Move on 4-5 years. I recently learned about linux and creating things from scratch like a game engine or so. So I tried it, Loaded up a VirtualMachine Tried linux mint, switched to arch, Enjoyed it, once I’m somewhat used to it I went yolo and installed it on my laptop. I tried creating a few simple programs here and there, that was a cool time. It felt like I was onto something and spoiler alert after about a month or so I stopped again. I don’t know why, probably due to laziness or something but afterwards I only did a few java and c++ programs here and there for school assignments.</p>
            <p>Move forward one more year later I was about to enroll College and oh god I was scared I feel like I haven’t really done anything I can be proud of (Which I haven’t duh) So I tried to put on a face again, I started doing sort of like a challenge, (One Simple Program A Day, One LeetCode Problem a day) Things like that, It's’ been about 50 days and I’m still going strong. Although currently a beginner, I’m currently interested/studying c++, shell scripts, and some basic web-dev (html css javascript), I have also purchased and tried arduino and electronics lately and yeah that's about it I guess, Tomorrow is now my first day of College and I’ve crammed this whole site in like about an hour or so. (I have no idea where I'm going with this) oh well I guess I’ll just end it with an expectation of what’s to come so uhm deep breath here we go:</p>

        <h3>Final Remarks: </h3>
        <p>Hi! I’m Ron Currently A freshman College Student pursuing a bachelor’s in computer engineering. I feel like I haven’t really done anything significant my whole life and I would like to change that these following four years. I hope to make new friends, meet more people, maybe join a club or organization here and there, have good grades, and make some projects I could be proud of (among other things). It’s nice meeting you! And I wish us all a Fantastic First Semester!</p>
